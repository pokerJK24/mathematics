template<typename Key, typename Value>
class Map
{

  //implement template of Map<K, V>
  //probably the best variant for your purposes is implement map, 
                    //based on hashes 
                    //or even simply - on arrays.

  //do not implement Map based on trees, because 
            //Keys can't be compared in some cases(for example, compex numbers)


  //you have to implement at least following:
    //some constructors
    //Key[] getKeys
    //Value[] getValues
    //put(Key, Value)
    //get(Key)

    //whatever you think is important (or probably I forgot smth)
